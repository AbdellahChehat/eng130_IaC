# Infrastructure as Code 

### What is IaC?

- Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
 

### What is Configuration Management ?

- Configuration Management is the process of maintaining systems, such as computer hardware and software, in a desired state. Configuration Management (CM) is also a method of ensuring that systems perform in a manner consistent with expectations over time.
### What is Orchestration ? 

- Orchestration is the automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications, and services. Orchestration helps IT to more easily manage complex tasks and workflows.

### What is blue-print deployment ?

- A blueprint is a package of deployable, reusable configuration and policy that implements and documents a specific opinionated solution. Blueprints enable developers to design infrastructure, platforms, and application services by composing and connecting cloud resources with declarative configuration.

**AWS BLUEPRINT DEPLOYMENT**

- This guidance deploys the AWS Service Catalog portfolios of tested and validated AWS services and third-party applications so that AWS Distributors and AWS Solution Providers can deploy, manage, and monitor solutions for their small and medium business (SMB) customers in the AWS Cloud. These portfolios can be deployed in a repeatable, and scalable, way to allow AWS Distributors and AWS Solution Providers to extend these solutions with their value-added capabilities.

**The 2 IaC we will be covering is:**

- Ansible 
- Terraform

### What is Ansible ?

- Ansible is a push-based Infrastructure as code (IaC) that provides a user-friendly domain-specific language so we can define the architecture as per desire in a declarative way.
- It is used as a configuration managment tool 
- AnsibleÂ® is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more. Ansible's main strengths are simplicity and ease of use.
