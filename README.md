# Infrastructure as Code 

### What is IaC?

- Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
 

### What is Configuration Management ?

- Configuration Management is the process of maintaining systems, such as computer hardware and software, in a desired state. Configuration Management (CM) is also a method of ensuring that systems perform in a manner consistent with expectations over time.
### What is Orchestration ? 

- Orchestration is the automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications, and services. Orchestration helps IT to more easily manage complex tasks and workflows.

- Ansible is a push-based Infrastructure as code (IaC) that provides a user-friendly domain-specific language so we can define the architecture as per desire in a declarative way.
- It is used as a configuration managment tool 
- AnsibleÂ® is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more. Ansible's main strengths are simplicity and ease of use.

### What is Blue grenn Deployment ?

- Blue Green deployement is a release model the changes the traffic of users so that the organisation can update and ugrade their app wihtout causing a downtime. The users may be directed to an older version of the application while they work on the new version then the organisation gradually switches over to the new version making the old version a template or to be used as standby.

### Benefits:

1. Zero impact to users
2. More Stability
3. Zero Downtime
4. Save money on cloud
